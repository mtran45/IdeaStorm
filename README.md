# IdeaStorm
A web app for brainstorming and posting ideas, built with ASP.NET MVC 5.

## Usage
The app is divided into two main sections: Storms and Ideas. 

The Storms section is used to brainstorm for ideas by creating lists of idea titles. This is intended to be a workspace to quickly get any and all ideas out of your head, and is private. You can then select the suitable candidates from these lists to publish it as an Idea. 

The Ideas list is the main section of the page and is intended to aggregate ideas that have been properly developed. Ideas can be created from scratch, or 'promoted' from the lists in the Storms section.
